## üöÄ Usage

### üéµ Extract Playlist Information
To extract playlist details, use the `PlaylistExtractor` class:

```kotlin
val client = YoutubePlaylistExtractor()
val playlistInfo = client.getPlaylistInfo("<playlist_url>")

if (playlistInfo != null) {
    println("Playlist ID: ${playlistInfo.id}")
    println("Title: ${playlistInfo.title}")
    println("Author: ${playlistInfo.author}")
    println("Description: ${playlistInfo.description}")
    playlistInfo.videos.forEach { video ->
        println("Video ID: ${video.id}")
        println("Title: ${video.title}")
        println("Duration: ${video.durationSeconds} seconds")
    }
} else {
    println("Unable to retrieve playlist information.")
}
```

### üé• Extract Video Information
To extract video details and formats, use the `VideoPlayerExtractor` class:

```kotlin
val client = YoutubeVideoPlayerExtractor()
val videoInfo = client.getVideoFormats("<video_url>")

if (videoInfo != null) {
    println("Video ID: ${videoInfo.videoId}")
    println("Title: ${videoInfo.title}")
    println("Author: ${videoInfo.author}")
    println("Duration: ${videoInfo.durationSeconds} seconds")
    videoInfo.formats.forEach { format ->
        println("Itag: ${format.itag}")
        println("MimeType: ${format.mimeType}")
        println("QualityLabel: ${format.qualityLabel}")
        println("URL: ${format.url}")
    }
} else {
    println("Unable to retrieve video information.")
}
```

### üñºÔ∏è Compose UI Integration
Refer to the example implementations in the `sample.app.screens` package for how to integrate the library with Jetpack Compose to create user interfaces for extracting video and playlist information.
